attempt to take a users input and then compare that to a group allowing for 
a data base to be made showing the character and who owns it in the group

base features:
each item will be unique(same item cant be owned twice)
UI: make it easy to see who owns what
back end: allow users to export inputs to .csv or .xlsx

Extra features:
create own rolling database
website?
possibly integrate to a discord bot that can immedietly update a group data base(ya java script!)
